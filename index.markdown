  text: "Steve, bought The Stag in summer 2017 when it was closed and in a very sorry
    state. Together Steve and Oliver with a trusty team, took away the accumulated
    rot and decay to reveal the stunning interior of this amazing historic inn. Gently
    we are bringing The Stag back to life fit for the 21st Century. This huge project
    is still unfinished with more work ahead as we hope to realise our vision for
    the inn.  \n\nSteve is Owner & Kitchen.  \n\nOliver is Partner, Business Partner
    and Front of House."

### An English country inn set in the heart of the Devon countryside, The Stag Rackenford is rumoured to be the oldest pub in Devon, dating back to the 12th Century. Restored and now run by Steve and Oliver, both are passionate about serving freshly prepared great tasting food and an eclectic range of drinks.
