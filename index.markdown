  Dear Friends and Customers,

  We just want to let you know that we have come to the decision that it’s time for our retirement! Oliver is very much looking forward to this next stage of life after 53 years of continuous employment.

  So firstly, we have to say a very big thank you from the bottom of our hearts to our very loyal customers from near and far. Thank you for all your support without you we would not have got as far as we did.

  Then secondly a huge thank you to all our amazing staff who have worked so hard over the last 7 years. It has been a joy to employ and get to know many of the younger adults of our village and to see them flourish and grow. We will also never forget the trials, tribulations, laughs and fun into the early hours that many in the industry will know well.

  As some of you may know, I bought ‘The Stag’ in 2017 when it was a closed pub in a very sad state of neglect. I invested considerably with all my savings to reveal the amazing building inside that I have been very happy to call my place of work and my home.  Despite our hopes for a thriving and busy village pub, after 2 years of being open for lunch and dinner 5 days a week, along came the global pandemic which stopped us in our tracks.  However, we were able to keep serving our local community during the lockdowns despite the challenges that came our way. We now laugh at some of the scrapes we got into by never saying “NO”!

  We had hoped to weather the financial storms by reducing ever-increasing overheads through condensing our operating hours. However small hospitality businesses in rural communities such as ours have been hit very hard, not only by the pandemic but then by the continuing cost of living crisis, from which few of us are immune.

  I am very proud for what we achieved and to be owner and custodian of this very old building which stands as a testament to all the local craftsmen historic and recent who have worked to maintain and restore it.  But we have decided it is now time for us and our lives, the pandemic taught us how fragile and short life can be. It is also time to continue to make the building that we love able to withstand many more years and time to work out a new future for ourselves and ‘The Stag’.

  Thank you all.

  Our very best wishes,
  Steve & Oliver.

    state. Together Steve and Oliver with a trusty team, took away the accumulated
    rot and decay to reveal the stunning interior of this amazing historic inn. Gently
    we are bringing The Stag back to life fit for the 21st Century. This huge project
    is still unfinished with more work ahead as we hope to realise our vision for
    the inn.  \n\nSteve is Owner & Kitchen.  \n\nOliver is Partner, Business Partner

### An English country inn set in the heart of the Devon countryside, The Stag Rackenford is rumoured to be the oldest pub in Devon, dating back to the 12th Century. Restored and now run by Steve and Oliver, both are passionate about serving freshly prepared great tasting food and an eclectic range of drinks.
