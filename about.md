  text: |-
    ITV West Country cameras have been visiting the village of Rackenford in Devon, hearing the stories of the people who live here and finding out what makes a rural West Country village tick.

    *Rackenford Tales* gives a flavour of what it's like to live out in the country, to run a business, to go to a small village school, and how things have changed over the years for rural farming communities like this.
